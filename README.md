## Overview and Problem Statement
Credit risk is associated with the possibility of a client failing to meet contractual obligations, such as mortgages, credit card debts, and other types of loans. A payment default occurs when you fail to pay the minimum amount due on the credit card for a few consecutive months. Usually, the default notice is sent by the card issuer after 6 consecutive missed payments. Machine Learning models have been helping these companies to improve the accuracy of their credit risk analysis, providing a scientific method to identify potential debtors in advance.

Can you reliably predict who is likely to default? If so, the bank may be able to prevent the loss by providing the customer with alternative options (such as forbearance or debt consolidation, etc.). In this project, the participants are expected to

perform exploratory data analysis and derive meaningful insights and
perform pre-processing and features correlation and
develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is a credit card defaulter or not.
